# Data Science Toolbox
The following is a (slightly) deeper look at the data science workflow, with more details about specific software, programming languages, and other skills often used for data science.

As discussed in the previous reading by [Gentzkow & Shapiro](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf), everything that can be automated should be automated. That is how companies can make use of data science insights ``at scale'' (to quote the DS vernacular). In fact, automation is the reason we write code in the first place. And it's the source of innovation in data science.

Here are the topics we'll discuss today:

* Statistical programming languages
* Visualization tools (usually included with the above)
* Big Data management software
* Data collection tools

## 1. Statistical Programming Languages
The three main mathematical and statistical programming languages we will use and discuss in this class are R, Python, and Julia. There are many other languages that can be used for statistical analysis: Stata, SAS, SPSS, Matlab, and even JavaScript. Many of the languages listed in the prior sentence were built on C, C++, or Fortran. The latter three are known as **compiled** languages, while all other are known as **scripted** languages. Compiled languages require the user to write code that the CPU can understand, whereas scripted languages allow the user to write code that is more human-readable, at the expense of performance. 

Julia is the newest language and attempts to be a scripted language that can run at compiled speeds. R, Python, and others also have facilities that allow a user to insert C, C++, or Fortran code into the script and achieve greater performance. Such instances are often referred to as ``glue code'' as they require interfacing between different languages in the same code script.

Below is a table summarizing the main differences between R, Python, and Julia:


|                                    | Python    | Julia    |          |
|------------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Date established                   | 1995      | 1991     | 2012     |
| Approximate user base              | large     | largest  | smallest |
| Used for data science              | &#x2714   | yes      | yes      |
| Used for general-purpose computing | no        | yes      | yes      |
| Open source                        | yes       | yes      | yes      |
| Biggest advantage                  | tidyverse | ubiquity | speed    |
| Biggest disadvantage               | speed     | speed    | age      |
