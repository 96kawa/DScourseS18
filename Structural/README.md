# Structural Economics
The last part of our course will focus on how we can combine the tools of economic theory, econometrics, and machine learning to build better economic models. Much of the content of this session comes from various lectures given by [Susan Athey](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/susan-athey), who is an economics professor at Stanford and who is the foremost expert in these matters.

First, we'll talk about the main ways in which econometrics and machine learning differ. We've covered some of this in prior discussions this semseter, but it helps to lay out exactly what the strengths of limitations of each approach is, so that we know what the comparative advantage is of each.

## Data Fallacies
Before doing that, let's briefly discuss the following Data Fallacies (which I recently came across on [twitter](https://twitter.com/KirkDBorne/status/981390062540808193), full content available [here](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/data-literacy/statistical-fallacies/#.Ws0BvOgbNmM)).
